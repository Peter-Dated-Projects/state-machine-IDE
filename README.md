## Overview

A visual, node-based integrated development environment (IDE) for designing and generating object-oriented state machine code. Users can create complex state transitions using an intuitive graphical interface, and automatically generate Python class definitions through backend AST parsing.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

- **React** – for building modular, interactive UI components  
- **Next.js** – for server-side rendering and optimized frontend performance  
- **Canvas-based Node Editor** – for intuitive drag-and-drop state diagram construction  

### Backend

- **Python** – used for dynamic code generation  
- **Flask** – lightweight API server to handle client requests  
- **Python AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)** – for parsing and generating structured Python code  

## Installation and Setup Guide

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your system:

- Node.js (for frontend development)
- Python 3.8+ and Flask (for backend development)
- A Firebase account (for authentication and database)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Peter-Dated-Projects/state-machine-IDE
   cd state-machine-IDE
   ```
